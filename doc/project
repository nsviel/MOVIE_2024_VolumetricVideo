Abstract
-----------------
The objective of this project is to develop a prototype for a volumetric video system using three depth cameras. This system will require registering the viewpoints of each camera into a unified reference coordinate system. Once the registration is complete, the prototype can be applied to various case studies, such as digitizing a handcraft professional, capturing a dancing individual, or other dynamic subjects.


Steps
-----------------
-Display 3D Point Cloud: Visualize the point cloud data captured by the depth cameras.
-Extract Color and Depth Images: Retrieve both color and depth images from each camera for further processing.
-Apply ONNX Segmentation Model: Utilize the ONNX segmentation model from Segment Anything to segment the subjects within the captured images.
-Feature Extraction and Matching: Employ OpenCV to extract features from the images and match them across the different camera views.
-Optimization Using Newton's Method: Implement basic Newton optimization techniques to derive the translation and rotation parameters for aligning the camera views.
-Transformation Matrix Calculation: Construct transformation matrices from the obtained parameters and apply them to adjust the camera positions accordingly.
